  "intro": "The imagery in Brunel’s Network allows you to explore each of the people involved in creating the Great Western, Great Britain and Great Eastern, and how they were connected to one another. ",
  "paraOne": "Hovering over a node (person) will highlight who they were connected to during the project, either through prior acquaintance, or correspondence during the project itself.",
  "paraTwo": "Clicking on a node will bring up an information panel.  This panel includes a biography of the individual and their role in the project, and the documentary evidence from which all the information has been taken.  For individuals with lengthier entries, these information panes can be expanded. ",
  "paraThree": "You can also move and manipulate the imagery yourself in order to explore specific sets of relationships or people, and/or to cluster together those you may be interested in.  When you do this, you will be able to take a snapshot of your arrangement.  The people are currently arranged by influence (size) contribution (commercial or engineering) and by the relationship information provided by the sources – these show that the strongest conduit between commercial and engineering figures was Brunel himself, so he is placed near centre, with the strongest and most numerous links across the two groups.",
  "paraFour": "Much more information is included in the analysis tab.  When bringing up the analysis tab, you will be able to filter out commercial or engineering figures, in order to focus on one or the other group, and also to enable a timeline that shows the network and its relationships growing as the ships were planned, built and launched.  There are also search functions to allow a person to be searched by name, and reset options to set the graphs back to their initial configuration.  The best way to take information from the graphs is simply to explore!"
