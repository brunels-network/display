  "intro": "Brunel's Network is a visual representation of the network of people involved in the conception and creation of the revolutionary 19th century ships Great Western, Great Britain and Great Eastern, which each centred on Isambard Kingdom Brunel.",
  "introParaOne": "These vessels were of major global significance.  The Great Western [built 1836-7, launched 1838] was the first purpose-built steamship to cross the Atlantic on engine power alone.  It shortened the Atlantic crossing from Britain to North America from 5-6 weeks to 14 days, and proved the concept of mechanised ocean sailing. The Great Britain [built 1839-43, launched 1845] was the first ocean-going ship built of iron, and the first to use a propeller for motive force.  It is the prototype of the modern ship, having revolutionised both materials science and marine propulsion in one step. The Great Eastern [built 1854-9, launched 1860] was the largest ship in the world until its dimensions were surpassed in the early 20th century.  It included major innovations in naval architecture but was a commercial and mechanical failure in the passenger trade.  It was sufficiently massive, however, to carry and lay the first working, continuous length of telegraph cable from Europe to North America [1865], and spent several years laying the first electronic international communications system.",
  "introParaTwo": "This project seeks to evaluate the relationships between, and contributions made by the individuals involved in creating these vessels.  It helps us to understand communities of innovation in the Victorian era, and how they coalesced to create advances in both technology and global interconnection.",
  "methodHeader": "Method",
  "methodParaOne": "The imagery in Brunel’s network is made up of nodes (people) and edges (links between them).  The nodes are all the individuals mentioned in contemporary documents detailing the planning, financing and construction of the vessels.  Edges represent links between two (or more) individuals that are revealed in contemporary sources.    Sources that detail nodes and edges, or relationships, between them may not be the same.  For example, nodes may have come from a printed list of proprietors for the given vessel, or a contract for building work on that vessel.  Such documents would not necessarily reveal any links between the proprietors and builders.  The connections, or edges, between individuals might however be revealed in city council minutes or the board meeting of another company that reveal an ongoing and pre-existing relationship between the nodes involved in different aspects of the vessel.  In many cases, both node and edge are revealed in the same document, for examine correspondence about the given ship.  Every node and edge in Brunel’s Network is derived from a contemporary historical source.",
  "methodParaTwo": "Within the imagery, the thickness of edges is determined by the number of documents demonstrating personal or professional connection between nodes.  The size of a given node represents the significance of that persons input to the project, and is derived from contextual evidence in the sources.  Documentary sources reveal a multitude of roles and levels of input, each allocated a point score once a large, contextual sample begins to accumulate. Scores are awarded based on explicit evidence, such as the adoption of an engineering suggestion by the node, or acknowledgement for conducting a building process, or supply of material, or investment.   'Conduit' scores are also allocated when a node provides a connection to another node who gives input to the project. The ultimate size of the node is determined by their aggregate score from all documentary evidence.",
  "sourcesHeader": "Sources",
  "sourcesParaOne": "The baseline network was derived from material held in the Brunel Institute.  The correspondence volumes of IK Brunel reveal a core network of individuals involved in each project.  Many of those individuals have also had their own correspondence and professional archives preserved, in sites around the UK, providing a second set of material.  Many individuals did not have personal correspondence extant, but were members of external groups and organisations, whose documents can contextualise their working lives, investments and relationships, providing a third set of material.  So far, a fourth area of research is largely missing – being the details of physical builders and craftsmen, and minor shareholders, whose lives are unlikely to be publicly documented or collected.  In order to further populate the network, the project asks that any information from private and public archives relating to these vessels be considered for submission and analysis.  There is a ‘recommend’ source tab that will allow readers and archivists to do so.",
  "sourcesParaTwo": "The sources used in this project are highly variegated.  Brunel’s Network is not based in machine learning or the machine reading of standardised source material in order to track historical connections.  The project is an attempt gather, cohere and visually represent the role of connected historical agents in given historical outcomes.  This has been achieved by creating a data model for archival reading and research, which subsequently allows diverse sources and broad research results to be displayed visually. Such an approach - analysing an outcome as a product of its interactions and inputs  - has generated significant new findings, whilst allowing extensive and diverse archival information to be represented in a meaningful way for academic and public consumption."
